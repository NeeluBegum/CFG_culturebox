    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p> If you've ever been introduced to someone from another country and thought "I don't know anything about their country", then you know why we wanted to start The Culture Box.</p>
    <p> The Box helps you learn about a country's famous authors, artists, historians, landmarks, cuisine, and many more. So if you don't know about Senegal's literature scene, this is the place to go!</p>
    <p> We've tried to include as many different sides to culture as possible, from food to famous authors to landmarks. If you want to contribute something about a country you know well, like your favourite singer, we'd love to hear from you! Click on "Submit your work" to find out more about general guidelines and submit your piece.</p>

    <p> Have something to contribute? We'd love to hear from you! The guidelines are simple: write a few sentences (ideally a short paragraph or more if you need) about an aspect of a culture you're familiar with. You don't need to be from that country to tell us about it but it'd be great if you have some connection (maybe you speak the language or you love the singer who's from there). Don't forget to include a picture!</p>
    <!--Your name-->
